# MagicMirror
This application is my introduction to a complete, multi-layered application that can be further expanded upon with extensions, plugins, ertc.

I am creating this project with the help of the Smart Mirror tutorial from Michiel Wouters. The goal of this project is to learn the basics of Top Down layered programming, test-driven development, and dependency injection.

I hope to finish the base work by May 2021, and my idea is to create a foundational application that can be further expanded upon with extensions and plugins for different api purposes!
